# Project description

ðŸ“• ðŸŽ“ Our module's goal is to help new subscribers find a genre to start with. We let the user answer to 5 questions with a quiz, and then our AI will suggest
genres that they could like.
We achieved this with a machine learning agent, using Python. In particular we used parameter learning with Bayesian Model.
The training dataset was built from scratch, making people answer our questions with an online form.



## Documentation

Process documentation can be found in <em>documents</em> directory.
The AI module has always been in our plans for Biblionet. You can find 
documentation about requirement analysis and system design at the following

# Technical informations

In this section we introduce technical informations and installing guides!

First of all, you need to install Biblionet.
Follow the instruction at this <a href="https://github.com/StefanoLambiase/biblionet"><b>link</b></a> to install the project, but do it with this repository, 
as it contains the module.


## Running the module

We assume you have followed previous instructions and that you have a correct installation of Python on your PC.
Under the folder <em>/src/main/java/it/unisa/c07/biblionet/moduloIntelligenzaArtificiale</em> you should find a file
named "model.obj", which contains our machine learning agent already trained.
You can now run the script named "prediction.py". This will create an API running on "localhost:5000" that the application is going to
use to make predictions.

Run Biblionet, register as "Lettore", go into your user area and press on "Questionario di Supporto" button.
